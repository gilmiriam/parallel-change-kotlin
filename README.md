# Parallel Change Kotlin

### Your Task
Change the class `ShoppingCart` in the package `field`.

The class should be handle multiple int items instead of a single one.

Tests have already been written.

### Rules
The tests must not be red at any time. 

No compile-errors, no failures. (The only exception is for a few seconds while you write a single line of code.)
